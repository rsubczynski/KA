label.dashboard.content = History of the creation of Housing Cooperatives in Poland The idea of ​​the Cooperative was founded at the beginning of the 19th century in North America. It reached Poland, which was then under partitions, in the 1890s. Poznań (Towarzystwo Pomoc - Spółka Budowlana) and then Bydgoszcz became the cradle of the Cooperative. In Poznań, the creation of the Cooperative involved, among others Stefan Cegielski and Helena Modrzejewska. Soon, in the years 1904 - 1924, more than 20 Housing Cooperatives were created, including in Grudziądz, Leszno, Inowrocław, Gniezno, Chorzów and Kraków. During this period, various organizations were established to support housing, including Building Co-operative of Polish State Officials in Poznań (1900), Universal Society for the Construction of Cheap Residential and Worker Houses in Krakow (1907), Society for the Construction of Postal Officers in Kraków, Towarzystwo Własnych Mieszkań Nasz Dach in Łódź (1913), Association of Permanent Apartments and Garden Suburbs in Warsaw. However, the Warsaw Housing Cooperative created in 1920, which flourished in the years 1926–1939, gained the most importance. In 1921, the Warsaw-based Housing Cooperative was established.
